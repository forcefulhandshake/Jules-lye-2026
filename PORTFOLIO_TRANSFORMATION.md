## Design Philosophy

The transformation maintains the original site's elegant, minimal aesthetic while:

3. **Personal**: Content reflects Jules's individual journey and personality
4. **Portfolio-focused**: Showcases both technical skills and completed projects

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Replace `/public/images/involved-og.png` with a custom Jules Lye social media image
2. Update favicon to personal branding
3. Add custom photography to the Experience section
4. Consider adding a blog or case studies section
5. Set up custom domain (juleslye.com) when deploying
